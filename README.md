# SILTA - Simple Localized Tasks
A PRIVATE CODE REVIEW, PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PHASE
## Background
Hobby project SILTA started in early 2022 from the need to better organize the steps involved in Digital Forensics investigations. Inspired by the *Kirjuri* application *(github.com/AnttiKurittu/kirjuri)* the goal was set to improving the personal DFIR process documenting as well as staying up-to-date with the tasks outlined in the community best practices.

## A ~~Work~~ Hobby In Progress                                                                           
As of writing this on Feb 2023 the project is constantly evolving as new ideas for usability and better Python coding arise. Latest complete overhaul involves extending the design to support not just Digital Forensics projects but in fact any project that can be simplified merely to a set of tasks having pre-defined attributes where these can dynamically be configured by the end-user.

## Design philosophy
Minimalism is a major driving factor. Keeping both the user interface and application design concise is paramount. Pythonic expression throughout is of key importance. Documenting. Learning. Coding. Having Fun.

## Requirements
Current design is based solely on built-in Python 3.9.5 modules and utilizes the SQLite and JSON format for data storage.
