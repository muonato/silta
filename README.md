# SILTA - Simple Localized Tasks
PRIVATE CODE REVIEW
## Background
Hobby project SILTA started in early 2022 from the need to organize the tasks involved in Digital Forensics investigations. Inspired by the *Kirjuri* application *(github.com/AnttiKurittu/kirjuri)* the goal was set to streamlining the DFIR process documentation as well as 'keeping tabs' with the steps outlined in the community best practices.

## A Work In Progress
Project is constantly evolving as new ideas for usability and better Python arise.
