# SILTA - Simple Localized Tasks
PRIVATE CODE REVIEW
## Background
Hobby project SILTA started in early 2022 from the need to organize the tasks involved in Digital Forensics investigations. Inspired by the *Kirjuri* application *(github.com/AnttiKurittu/kirjuri)* the goal was set to improving the personal DFIR process documenting as well as 'keeping tabs' with the steps outlined in the community best practices.

## A ~~Work~~ Hobby In Progress                                                                           
As of writing this on Feb 2023 the project is constantly evolving as new ideas for usability and better Python coding arise. Latest complete overhaul involves extending the design to support not just Digital Forensics projects but in fact any project that can be simplified to a set of tasks having pre-defined attributes where these can dynamically be configured by the end-user.
