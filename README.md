# SILTA - Simple Localized Tasks
A PRIVATE CODE REVIEW: PROOF-OF-CONCEPT PHASE
## About
Single-user browser-based organizer for simple project management.

## Background
Python project SILTA began in early 2022 from the daily need to manage Digital Forensics Incident Response (DFIR) tasks. Inspired by the *Kirjuri* application *(github.com/AnttiKurittu/kirjuri)* the objective became to develop a personal organizer application for DFIR projects.

## A ~~Work~~ Hobby In Progress
As of writing this on Feb 2023 the project is constantly evolving as new ideas for usability and better Python solutions emerge. Current goal is to facilitate any configuration of tasks to be dynamically specified by the end-user without re-inventing the database model.

## Design philosophy
Minimalism is a major driving factor. Keeping both the user interface and inner design concise is paramount. Pythonic expression is of uttermost importance. Adhering to *PEP 8*. Learning. Coding. Having Fun.

## Requirements
Current design is based solely on built-in Python 3.9.5 modules and utilizes the SQLite and JSON format for data storage.
