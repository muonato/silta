# SILTA - Simple Localized Tasks
PRIVATE CODE REVIEW
## Background
A Hobby project SILTA started in 2021 from the need to organize the tasks involved in Digital Forensics investigations. Inspired by the *Kirjuri* application *(github.com/AnttiKurittu/kirjuri)* the goal was set to streamline documenting the DFIR process as well as 'keeping tabs' with the many tasks outlined in the community best practices.
