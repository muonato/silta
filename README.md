# SILTA - Simple Localized Tasks
A CODE REVIEW & PROOF-OF-CONCEPT
## About
Single-user browser-based organizer for simple project management.

## Background
Python project SILTA began in early 2022 from a request to help manage Digital Forensics Incident Response (DFIR) workflow. Inspired by the *Kirjuri* application *(github.com/AnttiKurittu/kirjuri)* the objective became to develop a personal organizer application for DFIR projects.

## A ~~Work~~ Hobby In Progress
As of writing this on Feb 2023, new ideas for usability and better Python emerge on a daily basis. Current goal is to allow the end-user configure task properties dynamically, without having to re-invent database schema to implement new business logic.

## Design philosophy
Minimalism is a major driving factor. Keeping both the user interface and code design concise is paramount. Pythonic expression is of uttermost importance. Adherence to *PEP 8*. Learning. Coding. Having Fun.

## Requirements
Current design is based solely on built-in Python 3.9.5 modules and utilizes SQLite for data storage.
